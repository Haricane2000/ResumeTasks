I'll cry about it later
I'll cry about it later
Tonight, I'm havin' fun
Tonight, I'm havin' fun
I'll cry about it later
I'll cry about it later
Tonight I'm gettin' some
Tonight I'm gettin' something brand new

I know tomorrow, I'll be left hungover
But I'm ready for a shameless summer
Champagne on ice only makes you stronger
